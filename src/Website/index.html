                    <p>
                        Software Engineer with more than 10 years of experience. My passion for programming started when I wrote my first "Hello World" 
                        program in Pascal at the age of 15. I started my professional career with C# .NET version 1.1, since then I've had the opportunity 
                        to follow their evolution to the most recent versions including .NET Core as well as working in a wide range of technologies. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the last 4 years, my interest in Cloud technologies and DevOps culture has significantly increased to the point of actively 
                        participating in redesigning the infrastructure and becoming the go to person in my team regarding AWS tasks. I actively 
                        encourage infrastructure as code and tasks automation to eliminate human error wherever possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've experienced different working environments from solo freelancer to teams of 10+ developers, from Cuba, Argentina and now 
                        the UK. I like to apply the best design patterns and practices along with the appropriate technology to each project on a 
                        case-by-case basis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My years as a professor have given me a wider vision and experience dealing with exposing ideas and interacting with people. 
                        While I'm a proficient full-stack developer, I prefer the back end side where the majority of the logic resides and is exposed 
                        as simple and clear interfaces to the client.
                    </p>

                        <strong>Cloud native applications</strong> - Recently improving my skills of Kubernetes and its implementation 
                        on Amazon Web Services. It's the best of both worlds: the portability of an industry standard and the leverage of 
                        the cloud provider that takes care of the underlying physical hosts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Serverless architectures</strong> - Currently focused on Amazon Web Services,
                        it’s exciting to see how we can leverage the cloud to build cost-effective scalable systems with
                        managed services like Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Infrastructure automation</strong> - It’s fascinating how a few lines of code can be transformed
                        into interconnected pieces of hardware in a matter of minutes. CloudFormation and Terraform being
                        those I’ve been looking into.

                        <strong>Linux and Raspberry Pi</strong> - From a primarily Microsoft tech stack background I’ve always
                        been curious about what’s on the other side, Windows at work and Linux at home is the way to
                        go. I also enjoy having fun with Raspberry Pis, from retro gaming to local streaming box.

                            is a learning exercise to understand in more details how Kubernetes works and a good way to give some
